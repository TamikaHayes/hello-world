Tamika's coding ideas and resources

Hey there!

I'm Tamika Hayes, and as of 10/26/18, I'm embarking on a journey to become a software developer. My goal is to begin working on the Khan Academy Engineering team in 2019.

I'm starting with the tiny goal of completing my first five pull requests for Hacktoberfest!

This is my personal Apollo mission.
